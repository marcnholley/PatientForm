# PatientForm

Patient form programmed in C# with Visual Studio

The electronic Patient Form is a simple but powerful tool, to help small medical practices or large hospitals easily enter, search, update, remove, and or save a patient’s medical information. All information on every patient is at the tip of a medical professional’s fingers. The Patient From has an intuitive graphical user interface that even the most tech illiterate person can easily master. Click the Add New button and just type the patients’ medical information in to the clearly marked text boxes, press the Save button, and instantly the patient’s medical information will appear in the grid view adjacent to the text boxes used to enter the information. Click on the desired patient row or shuffle through them using the navigational tools at the top of the program and click the Remove button at the bottom of the program to delete a patient record.
